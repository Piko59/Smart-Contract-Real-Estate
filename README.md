# Real Estate Auction Smart Contract

This repository contains a blockchain-based smart contract for managing real estate auctions. The project leverages decentralized technology to create a transparent and secure auction process for property transactions, ensuring all bids are recorded immutably on the blockchain and that the highest bidder wins the auctioned property.

## Project Overview
The Real Estate Auction Smart Contract provides a decentralized solution for real estate auctions, allowing property owners to list properties for auction and enabling bidders to place offers transparently. The auction concludes automatically at a specified end time, awarding the property to the highest bidder if all conditions are met, and transferring ownership securely.

## Key Features
- **Property Listing for Auction**: Allows property owners to list properties with a starting bid and set an auction end time.
- **Bidding Mechanism**: Enables multiple bidders to place bids, each bid being higher than the previous one to encourage competition.
- **Automated Auction End**: Automatically concludes the auction at the end time, awarding the property to the highest bidder.
- **Ownership Transfer**: Transfers ownership to the highest bidder upon payment completion, securing the transaction on the blockchain.
- **Refund System**: Refunds unsuccessful bidders after the auction ends, ensuring fair and transparent fund handling.
- **Transparency and Security**: All bids are recorded immutably on the blockchain, allowing users to verify bid history.

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain Platform**: Ethereum
- **Smart Contract Language**: Solidity
- **Testing Framework**: Truffle
- **Frontend (optional)**: HTML/CSS/JavaScript
